                    "Greetings Sir.. I hope you're doing well! I wanted to Thank
                    you for the time you have invested in me for CLAT
                    examination. I am sorry for not giving you the results up to
                    the mark in Clat . Thank you Sir for believing in me even
                    when no one did. Your guidance and your teaching was not at
                    all to be doubted. Unlike any other classes I have had till
                    now..your classes were the one that I really loved.You
                    taught me more than the written texts. Also I am aware that
                    because of your mentorship, I was able to handle the exam.
                    It's been years since I connected with any teacher, but you
                    sir, are that mentor with whom I can rant about the anxiety
                    that I deal while studying. I wanted to atleast Thank you
                    and tell you that Sir that there have been no fault in your
                    efforts..and I must say that you worked harder than
                    students. You taught so many good ways for handling things
                    that not many mentor talks about. Thank you for increasing
                    my vocabulary hehe. Although there's still much more to
                    learn from you."

                    " I acknowledge that my performance in CLAT may not have
                    been exceptional, but being under your guidance was an
                    honor. Despite my initial doubts, I achieved a score I
                    thought was impossible with your support. Before joining
                    your classes in August, I had anticipated a negative score,
                    but your teaching made a significant difference. Your
                    teaching style is captivating, and I, as someone who grasps
                    concepts with some delay, felt at ease from the very first
                    day at Zenith. Unlike others, I faced no issues while
                    interacting with teachers, experiencing no hesitation or
                    difficulty in understanding. If the opportunity arises, I
                    would gladly rejoin your institute for CLAT, confident that
                    I can now excel. I express these sentiments not merely
                    because I attended your institute, but because I observed
                    your dedication to your work, a trait that is remarkable at
                    your age. Your commitment is something I've learned from
                    you, and it has been instrumental in changing my life and
                    enhancing my overall experiences. It was an honor to be your
                    student. In addition to the valuable subject knowledge, you
                    imparted mental knowledge that is not easily delivered."
